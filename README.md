#PHYS 139 Final

The PHYS_139_Project file is the file used for data preprocessing. To run that file, you will need to change the directories used in the ipynb to import and download files to the directories where the data files are stored on your computer.

The PHYS_139_Project_Model_V2 file is where the model is trained to predict superconductive materials. You can obtain the relevant data files by running the preprocessing file, or you may skip that step and used the provided cleaned_supercon_df.csv and final_design_matrix_supercond.csv files. You will need to once again change the directories in the ipynb used to import the data to the directories where teh data files are stored on your computer.
